This setup is for easily building an executable version of a piece of music created using Clinkster.

Proceed as follows:

1. Place your music here, named music.xrns.
2. Place a text file containing the text you would like the executable to
   print at startup, named music.txt.
3. Optionally modify the Crinkler options in crinkler_options.txt (read the
   Crinkler manual for details).
4. Run build.bat.

An executable version of your music will be created, named music.exe.

Enjoy!
