These are the binary versions of the VST instrument, ready to use in Renoise
(or other VST hosts).

For Windows: Clinkster.dll
For Mac OS X: Clinkster.vst (unpack the zip)

To use the VST in Renoise, in the preferences, under Plug/Misc, set one of the
paths under "VST Plugins" to a directory containing the VST, and hit "Rescan".
Under the "Instrument Settings" tab, Clinkster should now show up in the
"Instrument" pop-up menu. Click "Ext. Editor" or double-click on the
instrument in the instrument list to edit the instrument parameters.
